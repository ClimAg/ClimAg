    ```

1.  Create a branch for local development:

    ```sh

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
1.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
    Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
    feature to the list in README.md.
1.  Make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
