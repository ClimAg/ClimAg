## Credits

Pasture model ([ModVege]): This is the Python implementation of the ModVege
pasture model, translated from Java to Python by Chemin (2022).
The Java model was provided by R. Martin of INRAE UREP Clermont-Ferrand
for the original Python implementation.
The original ModVege pasture model was developed by
[Jouven et al. (2006)][Jouven].

Some parts of this repository were created with [Cookiecutter] and the
[`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`][audreyr] project template.
