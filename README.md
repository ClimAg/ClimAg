**ClimAg report:**
Streethran, N., Hickey, K., Wingler, A., and Leahy, P. (2024). *ClimAg: Multifactorial Causes of Fodder Crises in Ireland and Risks due to Climate Change*. Johnstown Castle: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Research Report, 464). Available at: <https://www.epa.ie/publications/research/climate-change/research-464> (Accessed: 17 October 2024).

ClimAg is examining past fodder crises such as the 2018 dry summer and placing them in the context of long-term climate change.

ClimAg seeks to identify the multifactorial drivers of fodder crises by:

- developing a detailed understanding of the multiple interlinked drivers of previous fodder crises affecting the Irish agricultural sector
- combining datasets from 21st century climate simulations with grass growth models to predict the frequency and severity of fodder crisis events under future climate change scenarios

Documentation is available at: [climag.readthedocs.io](https://climag.readthedocs.io/).
[This repository](https://github.com/ClimAg/ClimAg) hosts Python code for the grass growth model and scripts to perform data preparation, model simulations, and analysis.

ClimAg is a three-year research project funded by the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.ie/) (Ireland) under the Climate Change Research Programme grant number 2018-CCRP-MS.50, with additional funding provided under the COVID-19 research support scheme of the [Higher Education Authority](https://hea.ie/) (Ireland).

The authors acknowledge the inputs of the ClimAg project steering committee members throughout the project.
The authors thank Eoin Whelan ([Met Ã‰ireann](https://www.met.ie/), Dublin, Ireland), Paul Nolan ([Irish Centre for High-End Computing](https://www.ichec.ie/), Dublin, Ireland), and Elodie Ruelle ([Teagasc](https://www.teagasc.ie/animals/dairy/moorepark/), Moorepark, Ireland) for providing datasets used in this study.

The Python implementation of the [ModVege](https://code.europa.eu/agri4cast/modvege) pasture model adapted for use in this project was translated from Java to Python by Y. Chemin of [JRC Ispra](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-sites-across-europe/jrc-ispra-italy_en).
This Python implementation was originally published as public domain software on GitHub under the [Unlicence license](https://github.com/ClimAg/modvege).
The Java model was provided by R. Martin of [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en) UREP Clermont-Ferrand for the original Python implementation.
The original ModVege pasture model was developed by [Jouven *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2006.00515.x).

## Installation
